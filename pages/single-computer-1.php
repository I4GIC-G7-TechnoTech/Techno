                    It was only a few years back that we were all prematurely declaring the death of the PC, thanks to the swarm of tablet computers that flooded market following the lead of the iPad in 2010. While a handful of these slates saw success, many did not, as many buyers grew interested in Chromebooks and 2-in-1 devices.

                    As new device categories have penetrated the market, those interested in touchscreens and lengthy battery life are now given the option of Ultrabooks, such as the HP Spectre. Still, if you aren’t deterred by the prospect of malware, more traditional offerings, like the MacBook, still remain.

                    That said, the versatility of convertibles like the Acer Swift 7 comes in handy for more than just creative types. For instance, if you’ve ever wanted to binge-watch a Netflix show in bed, having a 2-in-1 notebook means you can do so with or without the obstruction of a physical keyboard.

            <h4><b>1. Dell XPS 13</b></h4>
                <p>
                <i>CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | Screen: 13.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD</i>

                With the 2016 model, the Dell XPS 13 reigns supreme as the best laptop you can buy today. Thin and light with a battery life that exceeds 7 hours, according to our movie test, Dell’s flagship laptop is the posterchild for Ultrabooks. Once again, too, Dell has managed to squeeze a 13.3-inch screen into an 11-inch frame, proving the nigh-borderless InfinityEdge display to be a design marvel. Outfitted with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors and lightning-fast storage and memory, the Dell XPS 13 is dressed to impress with welcome addition of a Rose Gold color option as well. It should comes as no surprise, then, that we still rank it as the best Ultrabook and best laptop overall.</p>

            <h4><b>2. Asus ZenBook UX305</b></h4>
                <p><i>CPU: Intel Core Intel Core M3-6Y30 – M7-6Y75 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – QHD+ (3200 x 1800) IPS display | Storage: 256GB – 512GB SSD.</i>

                If you're looking for a Windows alternative to Apple's latest rose-tinted MacBook, the Asus ZenBook UX305 might be more your speed. Though it looks like a Cupertino design from every angle, it's actually superior to Apple's creations in almost every way. From its purple-tinged aluminum design to its sharp display and hearty helping of built-in storage space, the UX305 puts Windows back in style, fanless design, long battery life and all. And, while the low-cost is enticing, if you're shopping for something with a bit more horsepower (not to mention an even more compact design), look no further than the Asus ZenBook 3.

            <h4><b>3. Razer Blade Stealth</b></h4>
                <p><i>CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB – 16GB | Screen: 12.5-inch, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,440) – 4K (3,840 x 2,160) IGZO LED-backlit multi-touch | Storage: 128GB – 1TB SSD</i>
                <hr>
               The Razer Blade Stealth is an exceptional Ultrabook hindered only by its efforts in trying to be a gaming laptop. Price-wise, it has the upperhand against key competitors, but don’t be fooled – with an Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, the latest Blade Stealth is more powerful and power-efficient than ever. Better yet, this laptop can change the lighting of each key on its keyboard, with more than 16.8 million colors to choose from. Plus, if you mind the integrated graphics from Intel, you can attach a (albeit rather pricey) Razer Core external GPU enclosure for boosted performance when stationary.</p>

                <h4><b>4. Asus Chromebook Flip</b></h4>
                <p><i>CPU: Intel Pentium – Core m3 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 4GB | Screen: 12.5-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) LED backlit anti-glare | Storage: 32GB – 64GB eMMC</i>
                <hr>
                When Asus first came out with the Chromebook Flip as a “premium” offering, we were skeptical. Premium Chromebooks had been done before with little to no fanfare. After all, who would want to spend over a grand on a laptop that’s limited to the Chrome browser and a handful of Android apps? This concept becomes more enticing when you cut the price in half, as Asus has skillfully accomplished with the latest Chromebook Flip. Stacked with a gorgeous design, a keyboard that feels rich to the touch and even a 2-in-1 form factor, the Asus Chromebook Flip proves that Chromebooks can be premium without going overboard.</p>
