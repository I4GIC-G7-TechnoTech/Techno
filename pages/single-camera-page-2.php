                    Take your photos to the next level with the image quality and near-instant autofocus of the EOS Rebel T7i camera. A 45-point all cross-type AF system* and optical viewfinder lets you stay ready for that unforgettable moment with virtually no lag between what you see and what you get when you press the shutter. Fast and accurate Dual Pixel CMOS AF with phase-detection locks focus quickly and accurately to help make sure you don’t miss a great shot. A 24.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor helps you capture special moments from vacations to family events in brilliant color, detail and vibrancy for beautifully memorable photos and videos. With a maximum ISO of 25600, you can capture photos in low light with minimal chance of blur. Built-in Wi-Fi®**, NFC*** and Bluetooth®^ connectivity lets you share these precious moments with friends and family and upload them directly to the web.

                    The XC10 is perhaps the least-conventional model on this list, but it’s a viable alternative to the company’s other, pricier, Cinema EOS models. Designed for video but with high-quality stills in mind too, the model blends a 12MP 1-inch CMOS sensor with a 24.1-241mm image-stabilised lens, and packages it in a relatively compact body whose adjustable grip provides excellent flexibility. It records 4K UHD footage at 8-bit 4:2:2 footage internally, and you can call upon the Canon Log option to capture up to 12EV stops of dynamic range. You also get a built-in ND filter, clean HDMI output and focus peaking, and Canon even throws in a loupe so that you can use the rear LCD touchscreen much like an electronic viewfinder. With a smaller sensor than more traditional options, and at a similar price point, it may not be the best option for low-light shooting, but when you consider the zoom lens, form factor and value for money, it scores lots of points. The model was recently superseded by the XC15
