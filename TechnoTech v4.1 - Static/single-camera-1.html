            <h1>5 Best 4K Cameras in 2017</h1>
            <strong>Author: <em>Matt Golowczynski</em></strong>

                    2016 welcomed a barrage of new cameras equipped with 4K video recording, and now almost every major camera manufacturer has implemented 4K shooting somewhere in their lines. Perhaps most impressively, the technology has been successfully stretched over models of all billings. So, whether you’ve only got a few hundred pounds to spend or you're willing to stretch to a handsome four-figure sum, it’s likely you can afford a camera with the technology on board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just because two cameras have 4K recording, however, doesn't mean to say they're equal. The use of different sensors and different methods of capture, together with variations in output possibilities, mean two 4K cameras can behave quite differently.

                            At the time of the A7S II's review we said it was the best video-shooting stills camera available, and while much has changed in the market we still reckon it’s a compelling option for the videographer. One of its major selling points at launch – internal recording of 4K footage – has since been matched by many others, but it’s the modest pixel count of its sensor that splits it from its rivals. We found its dynamic range to be very high, and consistently better than rivals at higher sensitivities, while noise was also shown to be lower than cameras with more populated chips. It also has the advantage of using the whole sensor width for recording video, and of being able to record to the memory card while outputting 4:2:2 footage to a HDMI recorder, but proves itself to be capable for stills shooting too. Autofocus is generally fast and built-in image stabilisation is a huge bonus, while the body is sturdier than its predecessor’s too. Overall, while it may not be the newest model, its sensor and video specs give it a handful of advantages over its rivals.

                        It’s hard to know where to start with the GH4. With both DCI 4K and UHD 4K on board, clean 10-bit 4:2:2 output and a huge range of recording formats, not to mention the option to use focus peaking and zebra patterning, and to append time code to footage, it’s a massively flexible tool for video. You can also extract 8MP frames from recording, but one of the main draws for videographers is the camera’s short flange back distance. This allows you to work with a plethora of additional optics via adaptors, including the popular Metabones Speed Booster XL, which widens the effective angle of view and increases the effective aperture. It’s just been superseded by the GH5, which we haven't yet tested – when we do it’s very possible that the GH5 will become our Lumix camera of choice for 4K. If its release pushes down the price of the GH4, however, it seems likely that this camera will remain a tempting a choice for those on a budget.

                        The previous APS-C-based A6000 was a big hit with enthusiast users, and the A6300 built on its success in many ways, not least with the inclusion of 4K video recording. The camera records 6K footage that’s downsampled to 4K for the benefit of quality, and uses the efficient XAVC S codec that has a rate of 100Mbps. This is joined by Log gamma modes, 120fps HD recording (also at 100Mbps) and enhanced zebra patterning to keep an eye on exposure. Our review found video quality to be excellent, with no obvious artefacts and very good sound quality from the on-board microphones too, although you can also attach an external microphone via the 3.5mm port at the camera’s side should you want to boost audio quality. You also benefit from a 425-phase-detect-point focusing system for rapid focus and a 2.36-million-dot OLED viewfinder, together with 11fps burst shooting at full resolution, all inside a dust- and moisture-resistant body. Now that the price has started to fall it would also be a fine choice as an upgrade over previous APS-C-based Sony models.

                        The XC10 is perhaps the least-conventional model on this list, but it’s a viable alternative to the company’s other, pricier, Cinema EOS models. Designed for video but with high-quality stills in mind too, the model blends a 12MP 1-inch CMOS sensor with a 24.1-241mm image-stabilised lens, and packages it in a relatively compact body whose adjustable grip provides excellent flexibility. It records 4K UHD footage at 8-bit 4:2:2 footage internally, and you can call upon the Canon Log option to capture up to 12EV stops of dynamic range. You also get a built-in ND filter, clean HDMI output and focus peaking, and Canon even throws in a loupe so that you can use the rear LCD touchscreen much like an electronic viewfinder. With a smaller sensor than more traditional options, and at a similar price point, it may not be the best option for low-light shooting, but when you consider the zoom lens, form factor and value for money, it scores lots of points. The model was recently superseded by the XC15

                        “The best Micro Four Thirds camera yet” was what we concluded from our time testing the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, and video is one area where Olympus has made significant improvements over previous models. Not only do you get 4K capture in both DCI and UHD flavours, you also get clean output over HDMI at 4:2:2, a headphone port for audio monitoring and the benefits of Olympus’s fast Hybrid AF system, which works in conjunction with the touchscreen for even easier subject selection. Whether you’re shooting stills or videos, you also get one of the most effective image stabilisation systems we’ve yet seen, which will please those who expect to be largely using the camera handheld. Other reasons why the camera walked away with a full five stars include its excellent weather-sealing, lifelike EVF, and the capability to fire at 18fps with continuous AF and AE tracking. Those who want to easily achieve a very shallow depth of field may not prefer the smaller Micro Four Thirds sensor over larger-sensor offerings, but with the right lens and technique you can still isolate subjects from their surroundings on such a camera without bother. In any case, while Panasonic may have had a head start with video, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II certainly sets the bar high for a flagship Micro Four Thirds camera.
